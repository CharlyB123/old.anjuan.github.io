### OVERVIEW

Diversity and inclusion have become hot topics in technology, but you may not know how you can make a difference. This talk will help you understand that, no matter your background, you have privilege and can lend it to marginalized groups in tech. 

### RESOURCES

I'm often approached after I give talks about diversity and inclusion (D&I) to "provide proof" that D&I initiatives provide business value. Here are a number of links that provide the business case for D&I as well as articles on the state of diversity in tech (as of 2015).

However, I have never had anyone with whom I have shared these links come back and say, "You know, the evidence is overwhelming. I now believe that D&I provides business value to tech companies." So, I can only conclude that people who want proof that D&I is valuable actually won't believe any evidence provided to them. Therefore, while I happily share these resources, the people who ask for them are probably lost causes in the push for D&I in tech.
