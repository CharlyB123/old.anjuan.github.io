	<h1>Hi there, I'm Anjuan!</h1>
	
	<p>Hello, I'm Anjuan, and I like to build things and help others understand how to build things. I'm a software developer, speaker, and author. </p>
	
	<h2>**CAREER**</h2>
	<p>I'm a Technical Program Manager at a startup construction software company. I'm responsible for managing multiple software development projects and delivering products that customers love. I optimize the interactions of the engineering team, maintain cross-department relationships with other business functions, and roll out company initiatives. Prior to building software in the construction industry, I worked for 15 years implementing enterprise applications as a consultant for Accenture, Deloitte, and Infosys. I earned my Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering from The University of Texas at Austin and my MBA from Texas A&M University.</p>
	
	**SPEAKING**
	<p>I began my public speaking career in 2009, and over the subsequent years I have spoken at a number of tech and business conferences on subjects including tailoring Agile practices, effective negotiating skills, and growing as a leader in the technology industry. You can learn more about my talks as well as how to bring me to your event as a speaker on my Book Me page. Visit My Talks page to find slides, videos, and other resources. You can also directly contact me if you would like for me to speak at your event using my Contact page. I blog about my experiences as a speaker (including write-ups of my slides) on my Speaking page.</p>
	
	**WRITING**
	<p>I have written for various publications since 2006, and I have authored a number of books and articles for online and print publications. I love breaking down complex ideas into simple concepts and helping people understand how they can be agents of change in the world.</p>
	
	**PERSONAL**
	
	<p>I have been married since 2002, and I am the father of three children. When I'm not working in tech, thinking about tech, or writing about tech, I can be found at home with my family or riding my bike. Due to my lack of skill, I only dance or sing either alone or in very large crowds. My other interests include history, geography, photography, and travel.</p>
