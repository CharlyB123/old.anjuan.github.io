I'm giving [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) a try. I like that I can host my site straight from GitHub and the Markdown support is nice. I may even port my entire site from Google Sites to Jekyll. I'll probably need to re-map my domain, though.

I have the basics of this site figured out, but I need to learn more about adding pages and using includes. However, I'm growing increasingly confident that I can port my personal web site from Google Sites to Jekyll on GitHub. Or, at least another site I maintain.
